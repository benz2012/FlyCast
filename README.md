# FlyCast

FlyCast is an out-of-the-box solution to dynamic broadcasting without the need of a multi-person crew (cameraman, boom operator, etc). The drone intelligently works alongside a single broadcast reporter and accurately frames, shoots, and broadcast a live signal to a variety of media platforms all without a drone pilot. 

FlyCast is built on top of Tower which is a Ground Control Station (GCS) Android app built atop [3DR Services](https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-android), for UAVs
running Ardupilot software.
